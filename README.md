   - The system automatically extracts skills from your job description

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/signup` - User registration
- `POST /api/login` - User login

### Resume Management
- `POST /api/upload-resume` - Upload and parse resume
- `GET /api/job-recommendations` - Get personalized job recommendations

### Job Management
- `POST /api/jobs` - Post a new job (recruiters only)
- `GET /api/jobs` - Get all jobs
- `POST /api/seed-jobs` - Seed sample jobs (for testing)

## Job Recommendation Algorithm

The system uses a skill-based matching algorithm:

1. **Resume Parsing**: Extracts skills from uploaded resume
2. **Job Skill Extraction**: Identifies required skills from job descriptions
3. **Match Calculation**: 
   - Compares user skills with job requirements
   - Calculates match percentage based on skill overlap
   - Returns jobs sorted by match score
4. **Filtering**: Only shows jobs with at least 10% match

### Match Score Formula
```
Match Score = (Matching Skills) / (Max of User Skills or Job Skills)
Match Percentage = Match Score Ã— 100
```

## Sample Data

To test the system with sample jobs, you can seed the database:

1. Open browser console on the frontend
2. Run the seed function:
```javascript
const seedJobs = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/seed-jobs', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log('Seed result:', data);
};
seedJobs();
```

This will create 6 sample jobs with different skill requirements.
